🚀 Deployment


This section outlines how to deploy the {{ project_name }} project.

Deployment steps can vary greatly depending on your target environment (e.g., a web server, a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku, a Docker container).

Here is a general outline of steps you might need to consider and fill in:

1.  **Prerequisites:** List any software, accounts, or tools required for deployment (e.g., Docker, a cloud provider CLI, a specific server OS).
2.  **Build (if applicable):** If your project requires building (e.g., packaging a model, creating a Docker image), provide the necessary commands.
    ```bash
    # Example build command
    # docker build -t fake-news-detector .
    ```
3.  **Configuration:** Explain how to configure the project for the deployment environment, especially regarding environment variables or configuration files.

    ```bash
    # Example deployment command
    # ssh your_server 'cd /path/to/app && git pull origin main && pip install -r requirements.txt && python fake_news_detection.py'
    # or
    # heroku create your-app-name
    # git push heroku main
    ```
5.  **Running/Starting the Application:** Explain how to start the application process in the deployed environment, especially if it's a background service.
